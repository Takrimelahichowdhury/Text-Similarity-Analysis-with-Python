# Text-Similarity-Analysis-with-Python
Text similarity analysis is a common NLP task that involves quantifying how similar or related two or more pieces of text are. In this project, we use techniques such as Count Vectorization and TF-IDF Vectorization to transform text data into numerical features and calculate cosine similarity to measure the similarity between documents.
